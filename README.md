Daugman Iris Recognition Algorithms  with Python.

### DESCRIPTION:
Iris is one of the most important biometric approaches that can perform high confidence recognition.
Iris contains rich and random Information.
Most of commercial iris recognition systems are using the Daugman algorithm. The algorithms used in this project are from open source with slightly modifications, if you would like to use the source code, please check the LICENSE first!

### Daugman algorithm:

where I(x,y) is the eye image, r is the radius to search
over the image (x,y), G(r) is a Gaussian smoothing function. The algorithm starts to search from the pupil, in order to detect the changes of maximum pixel values (partial derivative).
